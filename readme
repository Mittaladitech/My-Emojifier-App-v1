The Emojify 

We are going to use word vector representations to build an Emojifier. 

If we want to make our text messages more expressive? Our emojifier app will help us do that. 
So rather than writing:
>"Congratulations on the promotion! Let's get coffee and talk. Love you!"   

The emojifier can automatically turn this into:
>"Congratulations on the promotion! 👍 Let's get coffee and talk. ☕️ Love you! ❤️"
